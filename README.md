## Overview

TechTravels is a global online travel agency that connects customers with specialized travel agents to make their dream destinations a reality. Our remote agents are eager to advise and plan trips for their customers in several forms whether it be via phone, video call, email, messaging, or in-person meetings.

According to the US Travel Association, international travel spending reached $93 billion in February, following the pandemic.[1] By 2023, it is estimated that 700 million people will book their travel online, with 83% being Americans.[2] TechTravels has a team of 200 agents who book over 100,000 trip reservations annually and is expected to grow over time.

Our database-driven website will track our Customers and their Reservation details, such as Location, dates, and the travel Agents they are working with. That way, we will be able to monitor how many customers we have and their information, where our customers want to travel, and the number of reservations handled by each agent. Our database will also future-proof opportunities we may want to feature or enable such as studying trends of popular destinations or running reports to see which geographical area most of our customers come from.
